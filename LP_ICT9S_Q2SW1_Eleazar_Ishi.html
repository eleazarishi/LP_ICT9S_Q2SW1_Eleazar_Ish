           Samoyeds are squarely built, sturdy dogs, with a fluffy plumed tail curled over the back and draped to one side.

The ears are prick and the head is broad. The corners of the lips curl up to give the characteristic "Sammie smile." Samoyeds should have nice dark pigment around the eyes, nose, and lips despite the white coat color.

The sparkling white coat is the glory of the Samoyed breed. As would be expected for a breed of northern origin, this is a thick, harsh, straight coat with a very full undercoat. The color is a striking white though biscuit or cream coloration is allowed. The coat stands out from the body giving a fluffy appearance to the Samoyed. <br><br>

          The Siberian husky has erect ears and eyes of brown to blue or maybe even one of each color.

The neck is carried straight and the topline is level. The well-furred tail is carried up in a sickle or sometimes straight out behind.

Siberian huskies have a very dense, plush coat with plenty of undercoat. A small ruff is found around the neck but no long fringes on the legs or tail. Color ranges from black to white and everything in-between. Most dogs do have white markings, particularly on the chest and legs.<br></br>

         The tiny Pomeranian, long a favorite of royals and commoners alike, has been called the ideal companion. The glorious coat, smiling, foxy face, and vivacious personality have helped make the Pom one of the world's most popular toy breeds. Â¿The Pomeranian combines a tiny body (no more than seven pounds) and a commanding big-dog demeanor. The abundant double coat, with its frill extending over the chest and shoulders, comes in almost two dozen colors, and various patterns and markings, but is most commonly seen in orange or red. Alert and intelligent, Pomeranians are easily trained and make fine watchdogs and perky pets for families with children old enough to know the difference between a toy dog and a toy. Poms are active but can be exercised with indoor play and short walks, so they are content in both the city and suburbs. They will master tricks and games with ease, though their favorite activity is providing laughs and companionship to their special human.<br></br>
